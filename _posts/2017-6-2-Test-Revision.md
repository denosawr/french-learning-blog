### Possession
#### Possessive Adjectives
Possessive adjectives are adjectives used to show ownership.

| word | m | f | before a vowel | plural |
| - | - | - | - | ----- |
| the             | le  | la  | l'  | les |
| a (an)          | un  | une | N/A | des |
| my              | mon | ma  | mon | mes |
| your (singular) | ton | ta  | ton | tes |
| his/her         | son | sa  | son | ses |

Don't forget that French vowels include the letter `h` (i.e. `a, e, i, o, u, h`). The gender of the adjective depends on **the gender of the noun** it describes. For instance, `his eraser` would consist of two words: the possessive adjective for 'his' and the word for 'eraser'. In this case `eraser` is `gomme`, a _feminine_ word, so the French translation would be `sa gomme`. Even though we are talking about _his_ eraser, the gender of the noun the adjective describes (`gomme`) is feminine so we use the feminine version of the word.
#### Showing possession... without using `'s`
In English there are two ways to use the apostrophe.

* To show possession i.e. `Marc's book` means `the book belonging to Marc` or `the book of Marc` or `the clowns' book` meaning `the book belonging to the clowns`.
* To show omission (also known as contraction) i.e. `we'll` uses the apostrophe to show that there is a missing ` sha` there (`we'll = we shall`) or `it's` means `it is`.

In French, though, we **cannot use apostrophes for possession**. Read that again: **no `'s`**. You **cannot write `Jean-Pierre's livre` in French**. The apostrophe only serves to indicate **contraction** i.e. `J'ai` means `je ai`.

Instead, in French, we write like this: `le livre de Jean-Pierre`. Let's break this sentence down to understand what it means:

* `le` - `the`. This changes form depending on the object(s). We can use the table above to see: `le` - masculine, `la` - feminine and `les` - plural.
* **`livre`** - `book`. `le livre` literally translates to `the book`. We cannot get the gender wrong here.
* **`de`** - `of`. `de` has many meanings. In this case it means `of`. It can also mean `some` (as can `des`). Because of this it can help indicate the 'defining feature' of something - `la salle de bains` means `the room of baths` literally, or `the bathroom`.
* `Jean-Pierre` - `Jean-Pierre`.

#### Examples
What good could anything be without some good ol' examples, right?

* `La sœur de mon frère s'appelle Charlotte.` We can break this down into parts.
	* `sœur` - sister
	* `mon frère` - my brother
	* This implies that `la sœur de mon frère` means `the sister of my brother`
	* `s'appelle Charlotte` - `se appelle` or `calls him/herself Charlotte`
	* So, our sentence becomes `the sister of my brother calls herself Charlotte`, or `My brother's sister is called Charlotte`.
* `Le cahier de ton professeur est grand`
	* `cahier` - `exercise book`
	* `ton professeur` - `your teacher`
	* This implies that `le cahier de ton professeur` means `the exercise book of your teacher`
	* `est` - `is`
	* `grand/grande` - `big`. In this case we are describing a book, `un livre`, which is masculine, which means that the adjective takes up the masculine form of the word, namely `grand`.
	* So, our sentence becomes `the exercise book of your teacher is big`, or `your teacher's exercise book is big`.

Not that hard, is it?
